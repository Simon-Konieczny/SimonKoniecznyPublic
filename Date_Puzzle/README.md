This program solves the A-Puzzle-A-Day Puzzle where using a fixed board layout and pre-defined shapes, those shapes can be arranged so that only 2 cells in the board are left open, one for the current month, and one for the day.

The brute_force approach is to try all possibilities of shapes(and their rotations/flips) until the correct answer can be found.
